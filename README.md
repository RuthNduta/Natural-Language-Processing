# Natural-Language-Processing
A series of short and big projects with NLP libraries e.g. NLTK
## Notebook A: Exploring Text Data
   - In this notebook, I have taken the challenge of Analyzing Sentiments from Twitter data, so I'll focus on how to generate word frequencies and use it to create **Word Clouds** to help me get a better overall understanding of the dataset.

## Notebook B: Basic ML Model for Text Classification
   - In this notebook, I implement a text classification task to create basic NLP based features that can be created from the text and evaluate on the test data set to check it's performance.
   
   - **Objective**: To build a machine learning model to **classify** whether a particular tweet is **hate speech** or **not**.
   
   - **Conclusion**:that since we have used very basic NLP features, the classification accuracy (60.57%) is not that impressive. The goal of this exercise was to make myself familiar with the model building process and have a better idea on how to build a text classification model.
